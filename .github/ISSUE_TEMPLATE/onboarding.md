## :school_satchel: Onboarding new team members
<!--Add a welcome message tagging github username -->
Welcome @ <ADD_GITHUB_ID> :tada:	 

We recommend covering the following points during your onboarding. Some may not be relevant to your role, so feel free to skip them. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to tag ARC team members in this issue.

* [ ] Read and ensure you understand the project details and its stages
* [ ] Create a path in your root filesystem called `datasets` to download datasets
* [ ] Create your ssh keys as suggested [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
* [ ] Create a path `repositories` in your root filesystem where you will clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:UCL-CHME0039-24-25/<REPO_ID>.git`
* [ ] Setup [your local virtual environment](<TOADD>), [install python package](<TOADD>), and repository [`pre-commit`](<TOADD>) on your laptop.
* [ ] Get `bash scripts/unit_test_simple_ml_pipeline.bash` working on your local machine and follow [CONTRIBUTING guidelies](<TOADD>) if there are suggestions.

:tada: Great job completing the task above! Feel free to raise a new issue and suggest improvements to the repository. Otherwise, it's time to go for next steps!
